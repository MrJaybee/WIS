Web Infrastructure Stack Provisioning using ARM Templates
Overview
This README provides instructions for provisioning a web infrastructure stack on Azure using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. The infrastructure includes virtual networks, virtual machines, network security groups (NSGs), Azure Load Balancer, Azure Application Gateway, Azure SQL Database, and essential security and scalability measures.

Prerequisites
Azure Subscription: You need an active Azure subscription to deploy the infrastructure.
Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell: Ensure you have Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell installed on your local machine.
Deployment Steps
Clone Repository

Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
Navigate to Deployment Scripts

Change directory to the deployment scripts folder:
bash
Copy code
cd your-repository/deployment-scripts/
Modify Parameters (Optional)

Open the parameters.json file and modify the parameters as per your requirements.
css
Copy code
code parameters.json
Login to Azure

Use Azure CLI to login to your Azure account:
Copy code
az login
Select Azure Subscription

If you have multiple subscriptions, select the appropriate subscription:
arduino
Copy code
az account set --subscription "Subscription Name"
Deploy Infrastructure

Execute the ARM template deployment script:
csharp
Copy code
az deployment group create --resource-group "Resource Group Name" --template-file mainTemplate.json --parameters parameters.json
Replace "Resource Group Name" with your desired resource group name.
Monitor Deployment

Monitor the deployment process in the Azure portal or using Azure CLI commands:
sql
Copy code
az deployment group list -o table
Post-Deployment Configuration
Azure Key Vault
Store sensitive information like database connection strings in Azure Key Vault for secure management.
Azure Backup
Configure Azure Backup for regular backups of virtual machines and databases.
Azure Security Center
Set up Azure Security Center for continuous monitoring and management of security policies.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you can easily deploy and configure a secure and scalable web infrastructure stack on Azure using ARM templates. For detailed configuration options and explanations, refer to the ARM template files and comments within the deployment scripts.

For any issues or further assistance, please refer to Azure's documentation or seek support from Azure community forums.
